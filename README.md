A 74 key mechanical keyboard that doesnt need layering to access all keys.

the keyboard has 74 keys. made for outemu switches will accept any key that needs a 14x14mm hole.
No stabilizers required as the keys are short but recommended for long term use.
The keys may fit cherry-mx stem but that is not guaranteed.
The plate is pre-cut as it has to be strong after gluing together, use of baking soda/powder with CA glue is recommended.
Keys are left unmarked for people that use unmarked keyboards.
70 x 1u and 4 x 2u keys required.
Does not need modifier keys.
This repo contains circuitpython code for the project.
A lot of space is provided inside for batteries and backlights making it perfect to be used as a wireless keyboard with esp32 or a gaming rgb keyboard.
Use the test plate as holder for the mcu after you see that your switches/keys fit well and have ample spacing.
